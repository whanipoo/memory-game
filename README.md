# Memory Game Project

A project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Eva "Pornubpan" Sims.

## How the game works

The play will flip open 2 cards per turn. If the cards match they will stay open, if they don't match, they'll flip back. The player wins the game when all cards are matched and opened.

## Project Details

A timer was created to keep track of how long the player took to win the game. A moves counter and stars rating system were also created. Once the player wins the game, congratulations message and the results will show up so the player can see how well they did and how long did they take.

When the play click "replay" or "restart" button the game will reset. Card positions will be shuffled everytime the game starts or restarts.
